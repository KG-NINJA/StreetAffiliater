2. **Ensure you have a `requirements.txt`** file in your root directory with:
```
fastapi
uvicorn
aiohttp
```

3. **Remove or rename `package.json`** if it exists and isn't needed for your Python app. This is likely what's causing Render to think it's a Node.js project.

4. **Re-deploy** after making these changes.

If you want to keep Node.js files but tell Render to use Python, you can also add a `runtime.txt` file in the root with:
```
python-3.11
